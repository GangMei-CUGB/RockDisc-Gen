This repository is the original code for Paper: [RockDisc-Gen: A Python Software Package For Rock Discontinuity Generation]. RockDisc-Gen is designed and developed to construct and visualize synthetic datasets that accurately reflect the orientation and size characteristics of rock discontinuities according to limited field observation data, using four methods (the Monte Carlo method, the Copula-based method, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM)).
